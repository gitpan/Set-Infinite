Revision history for Perl extension Set::Infinite.

0.13
	Simple.pm and Element.pm:
	Corrected many warnings related to testing undef values on hash

	Quantize.pm and Quantize_Date.pm
	work on real sized chunks too - don't use `%' integer module operation.

	Infinite.pm 
	quantize returns tied array. It can be used directly with `foreach'.
	Pod and tests corrected.

	Infinite.pm
	Accepts slices as input. There are syntax problems - see "CAVEATS" in pod.
	tests added.

	Simple.pm
	Will not cleanup if acessed as tied array, until both a and b are defined or a method is called,
	so that we can set a, then b.
